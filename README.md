# Spotify API
_ _ _

This is a project to demenstrate my ability to access API's that needs authorization before accessing data. Spotify offers plenty of ways to Authorize, but for this project I used the Implicit Grant Flow. This allowed me to do it straight from a website without building a Server-Side program. This flow can be seen [here!](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/)

After authorizing the program gets your top 5 artists and displays them on the page!
